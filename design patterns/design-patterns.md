# Design patterns
Design patterns are reusable solution to commonly occurring problem within a given context in Software design. It's not a finished design that can be transformed directly into app. Rather, it is a template to solve a recurring design problem in code.

Design patterns are forms of best practices that developers have been using for a long time. They are not language specific, but rather language agnostic. They can be implemented in any language.

## Types of design patterns
There are three types of design patterns:
### 1. Creational design patterns
Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

### 2. Structural design patterns
Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures. These design patterns are used to form a large object structure between many disparate objects.

### 3. Behavioral design patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.

## How to use design patterns
You should not force design patterns into your code. They should be used only when you see that there is a need for them. You should not try to use them everywhere. They are not a silver bullet to all your problems. They are just a tool that can be used to solve a problem.
learning when to use a design pattern is the hardest part of using them.

## Most common design patterns
### null object pattern
The null object pattern is a design pattern that simplifies the use of dependencies that can be undefined. This is achieved by providing a default instance of a dependency that implements the same interface and does nothing.

### singleton pattern
The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

### builder pattern
The builder pattern is a design pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions. 

## facade pattern
The facade pattern is a design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## command pattern
The command pattern is a design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.
